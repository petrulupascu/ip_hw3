The piplene for this homework is quite simple

  input->preprocessing->feature_extraction->training->classification

    input: the mosaic image was imported by using the suitable opencv libraries and cropped , extracting each smaller tile
    preprocessing: 
      bluring->tresholding->opening
        the preprocessing part mainly consisted of segmenting the main blob from the input, I have realized this by using binary tresholding with otsus method,
        again using the apropriate opencv libraries.
        in order to further enchance the segmentation the image was blurred as well as morphologically opened(2,2 kernel) in order to remove noise before and after tresholding
    the 2 features wich I found to be most suitable for the task are:
      1) blob area: malignant nodules  seemed larger overall compared to benign ones
      2) blob circularity: as well the bengn nodules seemed more circular in shape compared to malignant ones(the circularity can be measure by (4*pi*area)/(perimeter)^2)
        while malignant nodules seemed to have more of a non convex shape with "tentacles"
    the model was trained by using a supprt vector machine with a linear kernel, achieving an accuracy of 0.8


for this homework mainly used openCV libraries for the image preprocessing https://opencv.org/
as well as the sklearn : https://scikit-learn.org/ for the classification 

regarding the plot and my own dataset and the plots due to time constraints I wont do it but:
  the classifier should be able to predict with a decent accuracy if the image contains an apple or and octopus due to the  designed features(I know its not hard to to this, I am just out of time)

in order to run the program run windows powershell(or bash on linux) in folder  and type ".\run.sh"
